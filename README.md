## Overview

[Human Cyborg Relations](https://humancyborgrelations.com/r2d2/) created by Michael Perl, has changed the face of Droid Vocalization through a fully functional AI, powered by advanced research into the speech patterns and emotional logic of R2-D2.

Each vocalization is unique. A sophisticated algorithm assembles R2’s speech "phoneme" by "phoneme." Billions upon billions of rules dictate how each sound should be selected, processed, timed, and sequenced to achieve emotional and canonical accuracy.

The [Human Cyborg Relations R2 Vocalizer](https://humancyborgrelations.com/r2d2/) has been ported to the Teensy 4.1 Hardware for stand-alone integration into custom droids build for the Astromech community usage.

All proceeds support [Force for Change](https://www.starwars.com/force-for-change) and [FIRST®](https://www.firstinspires.org/)
